# Death

Will come, may come at any time. Best to be prepared, aye?

* Make a list of things you would regret if you died and could retain consciousness. Fix those as good as you can.
* Make a list of things people would need to know about your life after you died, then minimize the effort they will have to put in
    * maybe an account on the server, accessible starting 3 days after the last login?
* Think about funeral arrangements, always have enough money for those
* Make a list of things you would want to say to people before you die. Go say them.
