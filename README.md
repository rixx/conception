# Conception - Conceiving Concepts

*Ideas gather, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no soul-sucking well-paying jobs, hold no large company shares, father no hipster startups. I shall wear no geek glasses and win no followers. I shall live and die at my laptop. I am the keyboard in the darkness. I am the researcher in the decades-old half-dead project archieves. I am the ardour that burns against the 9-5 boredom, the question that leads the ignorant, the beep that wakes the sleepy in the night, the spark that guards the realms of creativity. I pledge my life and honor to the Ideas' watch, for this night and all the nights to come.*

(Thanks to GRR Martin for that one.)
