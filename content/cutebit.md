## General structure

I don't want a regular blog. What then? Hell if I know, but I'll try to find out. What do I want to communicate?
 * Projects I have finished: Data. Explanations. Examples. Showing I am capable of stuff, helping others acomplish things. (several articles)
 * maybe a site with books I like, with few reasons. No full-fledged reviews, just that. (one site, later maybe more)
 * Links to sites I like. Reference-like. (one site, I guess)

## Look

Simple, simple, simple. like [this](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~fangohr/blog/) maybe?

Let slim header stay on top. Font needs to be dark, no bright gray font on white ground, nooope. nmnlist? bootstrap3? [cait?](https://github.com/hdra/pelican-cait)
