# Eisentask

Eisentask should be a todo prioritizer using something close to the Eisenhower method on a two- (or maybe three-)dimensional grid.

* Task should go from right to left on their own over time
* display next tasks
* add tasks via drag'n'drop
* good UI, without that it is less than useless
* maps! 3d! uuuh :D
