# Pastebin

Well, yeah. I want a pastebin. Selfhosted.

## Features
* self-hosted
* command line client / curl-able
* syntax highlighting (bonus: while editing)
* raw output
* maybe client-side encryption/decryption?
* expiration options, aswell as burn after reading
* deletion urls for pastes
* maybe make urls clickable?
* size and rate limits reasonable
* no search engine access
* clone existing pastes
* maybe comment option
* maybe vim mode
* maybe add passwords



## Comparisons
* maybe clone [zerobin](https://github.com/sebsauvage/ZeroBin)?
* also look at [dpaste](https://github.com/bartTC/dpaste)
* and of course [sprunge](https://sprunge.us)
